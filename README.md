Engaged in creating an application in a Computer Science II class project. 
The Java application receives any previous customer and sales data as input and partitions 
into different segments to be organized then stored into different objects. The objects 
created were members, persons, products and membership. The information used in the 
application is then stored in a database named MySQL to prevent any data loss.
