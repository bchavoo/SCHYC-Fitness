This is a class project created in Computer Science II (CSCE 156).

This project is a replacement invoice system for SCHYC Fitness. The data management system is a Java application
that uses object-oriented programming and is replacing their old flat file system. This means there is previous 
existing data to be transferred and organized. The application receives the data as input and partitions into 
separate segments to be organized and stored into different components. Each set of data is stored in the form 
of objects such as persons, members, products or invoices. The application then outputs formatted invoice reports 
of the given data. This is the management system that has been created for the company. This application manages 
the companyâ€™s memberships and services, including year-long memberships, day memberships, parking-passes and equipment 
rental. It creates invoices calculating the purchases that were made and allows to be sorted by certain criteria. 

The application uses a database managed by MySQL where the database is located and created. MySQL helps organize 
and break apart each attribute from the classes which describes a unique column of the database. This is where all 
the information is stored to and retrieved from to prevent data loss.

A Design Document is available on request.
